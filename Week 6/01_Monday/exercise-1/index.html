    <h1>Calculate the Hamming Distance</h1>
    <p>Write a function to compare two strands of DNA and count the differences between them. The Hamming distance is only defined for sequences of equal length, so an attempt to calculate it between sequences of different lengths should not work.</p>
    <p>Example: <code>GAGCCTACTAACGGGAT</code> vs <code>CATCGTAATGACGGCCT</code></p>
    <h4>The hamming distance of the example is <span></span></h4>
